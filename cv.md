<p>Over time, I realized that I wanted "something else" and decided to try myself in the front. My goal will be achieved with obtaining the necessary skills to work in a Fronted-developer. My supposed expectations are hard work and an unwavering desire for self-improvement. At the moment I work as an IT-Engineer at Alaris Labs and, at the same time, I study at the university in the 5th year.</p>

<p>I have basic knowledge in building networks and explosive information security zones. I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, some experience in database administration and system monitoring.</p>

<p>One example of my work can be seen here:</p>

<p>Studied at Geekbrains Information Security courses. Got basic skills in this area, but did not finish them, because at the moment, finding a job in information security abroad is very problematic, but for me, a profession with the ability to get a job abroad without significant problems is a priority. In addition to the courses, I am a 5th year student at the UNN. Lobachevsky at the Faculty of Radiophysics, specialty: "Information security of telecommunication systems".</p>

<p>My level of English: B1. At the current job, knowledge of English is a must.</p>
