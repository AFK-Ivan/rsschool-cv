Over time, I realized that I wanted "something else" and decided to try myself in the front. My goal will be achieved with obtaining the necessary skills to work in a Fronted-developer. My supposed expectations are hard work and an unwavering desire for self-improvement. At the moment I work as an IT-Engineer at Alaris Labs and, at the same time, I study at the university in the 5th year.

I have basic knowledge in building networks and explosive information security zones. I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, some experience in database administration and system monitoring.

One example of my work can be seen here: [Code example](https://github.com/AFK-Ivan/GBstuff).
Also, an example of a code solution from Codewars:
```javascript 
function multiply(a, b){
  *return a * b;
}
```
Studied at Geekbrains Information Security courses. Got basic skills in this area, but did not finish them, because at the moment, finding a job in information security abroad is very problematic, but for me, a profession with the ability to get a job abroad without significant problems is a priority. In addition to the courses, I am a 5th year student at the UNN. Lobachevsky at the Faculty of Radiophysics, specialty: "Information security of telecommunication systems".

My level of English: B1. At the current job, knowledge of English is a must.
